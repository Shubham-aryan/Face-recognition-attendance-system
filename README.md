The main use of this model is to mark students' attendance
automatically. This automatic attendance system, which is
based on face recognition, will be a time saver, reliable and
secure system.
In the future, the aim is to increase the rate of recognizing
the person when there are any unwanted changes in the
person, like wearing a cap, spectacles, or keeping a beard,
etc. Also, the system may recognize up to 1-5 students at a
time, which has to be improved further. Also, poor lighting
may affect recognition accuracy, so it can also be further
improved.
Proposed System Components
Following are the main components of the proposed system
1. Student Registration
2. Face Detection
3. Face Recognition
- Feature Extraction
- Feature Classification
4. Attendance management system.
Attendance management will handle:
- Automated Attendance marking
- Manual Attendance marking
- Attendance details of users.
- Email notification for absentees.

3.2 Proposed System Outcome
¬ It will mark attendance of the students via face Id.
¬ It will detect the faces via wireless camera (IP camera)/webcam and then recognize the
faces.
¬ After recognition, it will mark the attendance of the recognized student and update the
attendance record.
¬ The admin will be able to print these record details afterward.
¬ The students will also receive an email on low attendance rate.

Pandas: A Python package which provides fast, flexible and expressive data
structures and data analysis tools designed to make working with various types of
data both easily and intuitively.

Pickle: Pickle Module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object
structure by pickling being the way to convert it into a character stream for it to
be saved on disk.

Sklearn: Scikit-learn is a very powerful Python library for machine learning &
predictive modeling.

NumPy : A library for the Python programming language, adding support for
large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of
high-level mathematical functions to operate with.

Sip: A tool that has the ability to take existing libraries, written in C or C++
and making them available as Python extension modules.

Matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its
numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

Scipy: It is an open-source Python library used for scientific and
technical computing.

Random: The random module is another library of functions that can extend
the basic features of python.

18

Kivy: An open source Python framework for rapid development of applications that
make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.

Tensorflow: A Python library for fast numerical computing created and released
by Google. It is a foundation library that can be used to create Neural Network
and Deep Learning models directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the
process built on top of Tensorflow.

Keras: An open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of
running on top of Tensorflow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, or MXNet.
Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on
being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

Dlib: Contains a wide range of machine learning algorithms. All designed to be
highly modular, quick to execute, and simple to use. It is used in a wide range of
applications including robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high
performance computing

Os: The module provides a portable way of using operating system
dependent functionality.

OpenCV-Python: A Python wrapper for the original OpenCV C++
implementation. OpenCV-Python makes use of NumPy, which is a highly
optimized library for numerical operations with MATLAB-style syntax.
All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from NumPy arrays.

Six: It provides utility functions for smoothing over the differences between the
Python versions with the goal of writing Python code that is compatible on both
Python versions.

Openpyxl : The Openpyxl module allows your Python programs to read and
modify Excel spreadsheet files.

Pyexcel : Provides an application programming interface to read, manipulate
and write data in different excel formats and makes information processing
involving excel files less tedious.
